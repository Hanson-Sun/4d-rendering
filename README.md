# 4d-rendering

This is a mathematical invesitgation of rendering 4d-wireframe models in 3d space. I propose a method to move, rotate, and change the focal length of the 4d "camera". Along with the mathematical paper, there is also a programmatic demo using `three.js` and javascript. The demonstration renders the wireframe model of a 4D tesseract.

Read `math_ia.pdf` for more information.
