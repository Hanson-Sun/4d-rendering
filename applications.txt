quasicrystals and material science

its cool lmao

4d with time

translations and transformations and rotations in 3D

physics and einstein

Limitations:
	- no clipping
	- no rotation constraints (unrealistic warping at edge values)
	- doesnt explicitly deal with fov
	- no fov scaling and such
	- very unoptimized algorithm (camera rotation is very expensive)
	- very primitive method that only deals with points and lines
	- understanding differential geometry, collision detection and analysis, 3D
scalar field display, and tool path generation for 5-axes milling machines.
